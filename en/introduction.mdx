# What's DMA

Direct Memory Access (DMA) cheating is a high-level cheating method used in video games, particularly difficult to detect. Here's a simpler explanation of how it works:

## Understanding DMA

DMA is a feature that lets hardware access the system's memory directly, bypassing the CPU.

Since the cheating device operates at the hardware level and outside the operating system's standard operations, it can manipulate the game's data without being detected by traditional anti-cheat systems. These anti-cheat systems typically monitor software behavior, not hardware-level memory access.
