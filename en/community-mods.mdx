# Community Mods

The Scarlet community has created a wide range of mods that extend the functionality of Scarlet devices. This page highlights some of the most popular community mods and explains how to install and use them.

## What are Community Mods?

Community mods are custom scripts, profiles, and applications created by Scarlet users to enhance the functionality of Scarlet devices. These mods can add new features, improve existing ones, or provide specialized functionality for specific games.

<Warning>
  Community mods are created by users, not by Scarlet Technology. Use them at your own risk and always download from trusted sources.

    function OnPlayerDetected(player)
      if player.team ~= localPlayer.team then
        -- Draw a box around enemy players
        DrawBox(player.position, Color.RED)
      end
    end
    
    function OnSettings()
      -- Return settings schema
      return {

        },
        {
          name = "highlightDistance",

          min = 0,
          max = 1000,
          default = 500,
          label = "Maximum Highlight Distance"
