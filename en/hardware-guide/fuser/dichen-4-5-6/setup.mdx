# What to prepare
- A **Main PC (Gaming PC)** with an HDMI port, capable of outputting the required resolution and refresh rate.
- A **Second PC (Cheat PC)** with an HDMI port, capable of outputting the required resolution and refresh rate.
- 3 HDMI cables, capable of outputting the required resolution and refresh rate.

<Warning>
    **Before diving into the official installation tutorial, there are some essential information that you need to be aware of.**
    1. The resolution inputted in the fuser must be same. (The refresh rate can be different)
    - For example, if the main PC inputs 1080p 240Hz and the second PC inputs 1080p 60Hz, the output result will cause the ESP rendering overlay to run at only 60fps. As a result, the ESP rendering overlay will appear laggy.
</Warning>

8. You'll see some random characters pop up, that's fine. Close the dialog boxes and you can close all previously used applications and windows
9. Unplug your USB-C to USB-A cable from the Main PC.

### ④ Configuration
There are 3 Ports on the fuser. Grab your 3 HDMI cables and plug them in as follows:
- `HDMI` goes to the Main Monitor.
- `HDMI1` goes to Main PC (Gaming PC).
- `HDMI2` goes to second PC (Gaming PC).
<Frame>
      <img src="/en/images/dichenv17.png" />
    </Frame>
Once everything is plugged in, all lights should be on.

### ⓪ Meaning of Indicators
- **D1** - Power indicator. If the light is on it has power
- **D2** - Fusing/Overlay status. If the light is on it means the fuser is overlaying the second PC's output
- **H2** - Second PC input status. If the light is on then it means the fuser is getting a signal from the second PC.
- **H1** - Main PC input status. If the light is on then it means the fuser is getting a signal from the main PC.
<Frame>
      <img src="/en/images/dichenv18.png" />
    </Frame>

**Each button has a function:**
- **K1** - Press it once: cycle through resolutions. It should default on 1080p. Press the button to cycle until you reach your desired resolution.
Press and hold: Show current input information like resolution and refresh rate.
- **K2** - Increase the fusing strength/tolerance. The higher it goes, the more of the gray it will delete during fusing.
- **K3** - Resets the fusing strength/tolerance to default. This is what I use. It works nicely for every cheat I've tried.
- **K4** - Toggle fusing/overlay.

# Some Problems Solve
### Multiple Monitors
If you want, you can plug in multiple monitors to your second PC. For the easiest usage:
<Note>
    **Use Case**  
    - Some DMA software uses Client Mode (menu and radar integrated into one software), and this type of product is best used with a Second PC (Cheat PC) outputting two HDMI connections.
    - Users who want a dedicated screen for viewing the radar. (Users can also access the radar directly on their other devices within the same local network.)

    **Importants**  
    - Your **Second PC (Cheat PC)** must have **atleast two video output i/o (HDMI / DP)** and a **Second Monitor**.
    - Some products have a monitor selection option, so you can directly using that settings without this setup.
</Note>
1. First, your second PC (Cheat PC) should have two HDMI ports, each connected to:
    -  Fuser
    -  Second Monitor
2. On your **Second PC (Cheat PC)**, go to `Display Settings`, and you should see two monitors appearing in the settings.

    </Frame>
3. Choose the screen that outputs the display to the fuser. To identify it, click the `Identify` button, and a number should appear in the bottom left corner of each monitor.

      <img src="/en/images/dichenv21.png" />
    </Frame>
4. Select the Fuser Output Monitor, tick `Make this my main display`.
<Frame>
      <img src="/en/images/dichenv23.png" />
    </Frame>
5. Setup is now complete. When running the DMA Software, the Main Display should default to showing ESP and Wallhack. Drag the Radar Client windows to the second monitor, and it will work perfectly.

### Reset the Fuser
If you want to reset the fuser back to factory setting (you might do this if your EDID isn't working and you've exhausted all options), just plug the fuser back in via the USB-C to USB-A cable and do this:

1. Select the correct COM port.
2. Select the desired resolution.
3. Click the third button.
