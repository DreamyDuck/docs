# Proper Way to Use Fuser
<Steps>
  <Step title="Plug All Cable Correctly">
    Before powering on the fuser, make sure to connect the power cable, monitor DP cable, **Main PC (Gaming PC)** DP cable, and **Second PC (Cheat PC)** HDMI cable (you can connect the HDMI cable later if needed).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Power ON Fuser & Check Output">
    Press the power button. When the red light turns blue and stays solid, the fuser is in normal working mode. After a few seconds, the monitor should display an image. Check the small screen to ensure the monitor information is shown, and both input ports are displayed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Config the Fuser Settings">
    Set the desired refresh rate on both the main unit and the sub-unit. Ideally, select the highest option available from the list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm & Apply all the Settings">
    Use the rotary knob to switch to the next option and press the knob to confirm. There are four parameters you can adjust. When the white cursor is active, you can change the settings. After pressing the knob to confirm, it will return to the red cursor.
  </Step>
</Steps>
