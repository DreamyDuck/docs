1. Download and install the system Runtime Library from the cards above.
(Extrat, Double-click to run after downloading, and keep clicking `Next` until the installation is complete).
2. Extract the Speed Test files, and then double-click `DMATest.exe` to run it (do not run as administrator). When the `DMA read and write rate` is displayed normally as shown in the following figure, it indicates that the DMA is functioning properly.

# About Speed Test
Due to the use of different DMAs and the varying performance of the second computer, the `DMA read and write rate` may differ based on which USB port the DMA data cable is connected to. For instance, when using the Enigma X1 and connecting the USB 3.1 GEN2 data cable to the USB 3.1 port on the second computer, the rate can exceed 5000.

If your rate is below 3000, please verify that you have connected the data cable to the USB 3.0 port on the second computer. Generally, software that relies solely on DMA requires a rate above 3000 to prevent lag during use. However, for data packet software like Silver Shield Tarkov Radar or AG Radar, the DMA read and write rate has minimal impact on the radar. The principles of specific software will be discussed in other articles.

<Warning>
**Reminder**  
The read and write speed of DMA is the number of times it reads and writes memory per second, and the speed is closely related to the software performance. The higher the speed, the smoother the experience. Conversely, a low speed may result in lag, crashes, and other issues.

**There are several factors that affect the DMA speed:**

**Second Computer**  
Currently, the second computer has the greatest impact on the DMA speed, mainly due to its CPU and motherboard. If the second computer is too poor, its speed will be affected, resulting in poor software user experience. Generally, a desktop computer with integrated graphics is recommended, and a CPU with integrated graphics of 4th generation i5 or higher is sufficient. A laptop can also be used as a second computer, but the speed is relatively lower than that of a desktop computer and requires a CPU of 4th generation i5 or higher. If you have an extra computer as a second computer, you can test the speed after receiving the board. If you have not purchased a second computer yet, it is recommended to purchase a whole machine with 5600G as a secondary console. You can ask customer service for recommended stores to purchase from.

**USB port on the second computer**  
The type of USB port can also affect the DMA speed, but the biggest impact is between USB 2.0 and USB 3.0. The maximum speed of USB 2.0 is less than 3000. Therefore, try to plug it into a USB port above USB 3.0. It is recommended to plug the data cable into the blue or red USB port.

**Data Cable**  
Generally, the data cable that comes with the board is sufficient, but it is not excluded that there may be problems with the data cable. When you run the test file and succeed for the first time, then immediately close the test file and run it again. If the test fails, it is basically a problem with the data cable, and you need to replace the data cable.

**DMA itself**  
The impact of DMA itself can only be reflected when all other conditions are optimal. Otherwise, there is basically no difference. Currently, the highest score of our DMA can reach with a score of over 10,000 points, using an I7-12700K CPU as the second computer.

**Main Computer Motherboard**  
Currently, some users have reported that the main pc motherboard can affect the DMA speed. Do not directly purchase a whole machine or a Gigabyte motherboard, including Lenovo, HP, etc.

# How to achieve high speed / max speed ?
- Prioritize choosing a USB 3.0 port > USB Type-C
- Prioritize choosing a USB 3.0 port. If not available, consider purchasing a Type-C to USB 3.0 (blue port) adapter. Otherwise, the speed measurement rate might be affected.
- USB 3.0 cable

<Accordion title="âš¡ Highest Speed" defaultOpen="true">
    - Cables that support thunderbolt 3 + Thunderbolt 3 port.  
    - Get a PCIE to USB converter (On Second PC and it must a desktop) + USB 3.0 Cable. (BEST WAY TO GET HIGHEST SPEED)
