<Warning><strong>Completely Power Off Main PC</strong>.  
Before installing DMA, you must power off the PC and disconnect the power. Inserting or removing DMA while the power is on may damage the DMA board.</Warning>
<Warning><strong>About Kill Switch</strong>.  
For DMA devices with a built-in switch, turning it on and off must be done while the PC is turned off. Turning the DMA switch on or off while the PC is powered on can easily damage the DMA.</Warning>
<Tip>
<strong>Prioritize choosing a USB 3.0 port > USB Type-C</strong>  
Prioritize choosing a USB 3.0 port. If not available, consider purchasing a Type-C to USB 3.0 (blue port) adapter. Otherwise, the speed measurement rate might be affected.
</Tip>
<Info>
Both Runtime Libraries below are required for DMA to run correctly.

# Driver Installation
<Card title="Download DMA Driver" icon="cube" href="https://alist.scarlet.technology/Hardware/DMA%20Firmware">
FTDI SuperSpeed-FIFO Driver
</Card>
1. Extract the downloaded driver directly to the desktop.
2. Right-click on the `Start` icon in the lower left corner, select `Device Manager`.
3. Right-click on the `FTDI SuperSpeed-FIFO Bridge` icon with an exclamation mark.

    </Frame>

5. After installation, we need to confirm whether the driver is displayed in the device list. Some users' computers may automatically install the driver, so in this case, the `FTDI SuperSpeed-FIFO Bridge` icon with an ! mark cannot be found in the previous step, and we also need to confirm whether the driver has been automatically installed by the computer.
6. Right-click `Start` and click `Device Manager`. Expand `Universal Serial Bus controllers` and check whether `FTDI FT601 USB 3.0 Bridge Device` can be found.
<Warning>**Don't plug on USB Extender / Docker !!!** 
Some users may not have enough USB ports on the second computer and may plug the data cable connecting the DMA into a docking station / USB extender. In this case, there is a chance that the radar computer may not be able to read the DMA data cable driver. To test the DMA, it is recommended to plug the data cable directly into the USB port on the second computer.</Warning>
