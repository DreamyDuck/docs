# 2. Download & Install driver for JTAG
<Card title="Firmware Tools Pack" icon="screwdriver-wrench" href="https://alist.scarlet.technology/d/Users/Tools/DMA_Flasher.zip">Download & Extract the files into a folder</Card>
<Warning>
    Your DMA are either **I. RS232 DMA Driver (LeetDMA, CaptainDMA, Others)** or **II. CH347 DMA Driver (ScartletDMA, CaptainDMA, PeeperDMA, Hackdma and Others)**.

Try both if you don't know which one you are.
</Warning>

### I. RS232 DMA Driver (LeetDMA, CaptainDMA, Others)
1. Download the tools above and extract. Open `Drivers` folder -> Run `zadiag.exe`
2. Click `Options` -> `List All Devices`

    </Frame>
3. On USB Device, Choose `Quad RS232-HS (Interface 0)`.
<Warning>
    You must select “Interface 0", otherwise it is likely to cause DMA damage.
</Warning>
<Note>
    Can't find the device? Double check your dma is plugged to JTAG port or try [**CH347 DMA Burning**](/en/hardware-guide/firmware/get-dna-id#ii-ch347-driver-scartletdma%2C-captaindma%2C-peeperdma%2C-hackdma-and-others)
</Note>

### II. CH347 Driver (ScartletDMA, CaptainDMA, PeeperDMA, Hackdma and Others)
1. Download the tools above and extract. Open `Drivers` folder -> Open `CH341PAR` -> Open `CH341PAR` -> Run & Install `SETUP.exe`
<Note>
    Can't find the device? Double check your dma is plugged to JTAG port or try [**RS232 DMA Burning**](/en/hardware-guide/firmware/get-dna-id#i-rs232-dma-driver-leetdma%2C-captaindma%2C-others)

# 3. Get DMA's DNA ID
1. Based on your DMA board type (35T / 75T), run the corresponding .bat file
<Note>
    If you're unsure whether to choose `CH347` or `RS232`, just run both; one of them will display the ID.
</Note>
