# Firmware VMD NVMe

Firmware VMD NVMe fully emulates a genuine NVMe drive behind Intel's Virtual RAID on CPU (VMD). By running under VMD, the system and anti-cheat solutions see only the Intel VMD controller, never enumerating the actual NVMe device. This firmware includes a 1:1 CFG space dump, proper Base Address Register (BAR) support, and NVMe driver compatibility, ensuring minimal detection risk and seamless integrationâ€”just like a real device.

## Requirements
<Warning>This firmware device has high configuration requirements for the **Main PC**. Please ensure you meet the following requirements to avoid various bugs (such as blue screens, slow startup, etc.).</Warning>
* Intel CPU (11th Generation or newer)
* Intel VMD (Virtual RAID on CPU) must be **enabled** in `BIOS`
* Specific Intel drivers must be installed on Windows
* A Windows reinstall may be required for proper driver initialization and device recognition

## Features

### - 100% CFG
Your firmware's configuration space will exactly match that of a legitimate device, ensuring seamless integration and CFG detection as an authentic device.

### - BAR Support
BAR (Base Address Register) is the memory data inside the PCIe device. The BIOS retrieves this information to interact with the device correctly.

### - Emulation
Proper BAR response ensures that when the driver sends a message to the PCIe device's BAR, the BAR responds with the appropriate data, mimicking real device behavior.

## Compatibility

### - DRV Scan
Green on DRVScan Tool.

### - Anti-Cheats Supported
Supports ALL anti-cheats.

## Access

### - Unzip Password
