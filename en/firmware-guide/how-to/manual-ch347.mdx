<Warning>
    Please plug the type-C data cable into the second interface of the DMA board (if there is only one, it means your interface is either a two-in-one or does not support JTAG). The end of the data cable is connected to the 2PC (Radar PC).
</Warning>
<Warning>
    If you are using DMA for Valorant/Faceit. Make sure your `VALORANT` and `VANGUARD` both are not installed!! Uninstall both before inserting your DMA into your pc / firmware burning.
</Warning>
<Note>
    Make sure both PC have all VC runtime environments installed.

### Firmware Burning
1. Move / Paste the firmware you received from us into Flash Tools folder.
2. Rename the firmware file to `scarlet.bin`.
3. Run `#####flash_ch347_35t#####.bat` if your DMA board using `35T`.  
Run `#####flash_ch347_75t#####.bat` if your DMA board using `75T`.

4. Firmware burning takes up to 5 minutes. It may stuck at `sector 21` or `23` for while.

5. Wait until firmware burning complete.
6. Make a complete restart loop on `Main PC`:  
    a. Shutdown the PC. (Not Restart)  
    b. Fully cut off the power for 30s. (Unplug from socket)  
    c. Power On the PC  
7. Once **Step 6** is complete, make a speed test [**SpeedTest**](/en/hardware-guide/dma/speed-test) on **Second PC**.
8. All done once speed appear. Double check device manager on Main PC, make sure the driver appeared in device manager.

<Warning>
    Some devices can achieve read speeds on a **Second PC** even without having the drivers installed, while others cannot. 

    Therefore, the safest approach is to check the `device manager` on the **Main PC** to ensure that the drivers are properly installed.
