<Warning>
    Please plug the type-C data cable into <Tooltip tip="Nearest port to gold finger connector, used to firmware flashing and data update">JTAG port</Tooltip> and not the <Tooltip tip="Furtherest port to gold finger connector">Data port</Tooltip> of your DMA board (if there is only one, it means your interface is either a two-in-one or does not support JTAG). The end of the data cable is connected to the 2PC (Radar PC).
</Warning>
<Warning>
    If you are using DMA for Valorant/Faceit. Make sure your `VALORANT` and `VANGUARD` both are not installed!! Uninstall both before inserting your DMA into your pc / firmware burning.
</Warning>
<Note>
    Make sure both PC have all VC runtime environments installed.
