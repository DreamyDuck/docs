## Activate Firmware
<Warning>
1. The firmware must be activated on the **Second PC** when the computer is turned on; **otherwise, the Main PC will not load the system properly or boot up.**  
2. Activation is required everytime Main PC is powering ON.  
3. Make sure your **Main PC** is powered OFF.
</Warning>
1. After setting up your desired device in detail, sub-device information, etc. in Ditto, go to the `Settings` page.
2. Powering on your **Main PC**. (immediately proceed to the next step)
3. After the Main PC is powered on, wait for about 5 seconds, and then click `Connect` in `Ditto Software` -> `Settings` on the Second PC. (Start counting from power on, not after entering the windows).
4. After a few `Retrying to connect` notification, a notification will pop up indicating that `FGPA Connected` if everything is correct.

### Determine whether the firmware has connected successfully and initialized correctly

<Info>
  <u><strong>Determine if it's connected properly</strong></u>:  
  -  Windows will boot quickly, as usual.  
  -  A device you emulated will appear in your **Main PC** `Device Manager`.  

  <u><strong>Determine if it failed to connect</strong></u>:  
  -  Windows may get stuck on a black screen and fail to boot.  
  -  Windows may boot slowly, taking up to 5 minutes to load.  
  -  In Device Manager, a device labeled `USB xHCI Compliant Host Controller` will show a ⚠️ yellow exclamation mark.
</Info>

### Better Activation Timing?

#### For FTDI Devices
1. Open `Device Manager` alongside the Ditto application.,
2. Expand the `Universal Serial Bus controllers` or the `Universal Serial Bus devices` section.
3. When you see `FTDI FT601 USB 3.0 Bridge Device` or the `FTDI SuperSpeed-FIFO Bridge` appear, wait 5 seconds, then hit “Connect” in Ditto.

#### For ZDMA Users
1. Open `Device Manager` alongside the Ditto application.
2. Expand the `Memory Technology Devices` section.
3. When you see `LeechDMA` appear, wait 5 seconds, then click `Connect` in Ditto.

#### For Ferrum Users
1. If you're using a Ferrum, just wait until your mouse shows up under the `Boards` category, then hit `Connect` in Ditto.

This timing trick should completely eliminate your connection headaches.
