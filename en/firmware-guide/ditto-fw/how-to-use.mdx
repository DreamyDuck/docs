## How to custom your xHCI

## Activate Firmware
<Warning>
1. The firmware must be activated on the **Second PC** when the computer is turned on; **otherwise, the Main PC will not load the system properly or boot up.**  
2. Activation is required everytime Main PC is powering ON.  
3. Make sure your **Main PC** is powered OFF.
</Warning>
1. After setting up your desired device in detail, sub-device information, etc. in Ditto, go to the `Settings` page.
2. Powering on your **Main PC**. (immediately proceed to the next step)
3. After the Main PC is powered on, wait for about 5 seconds, and then click `Connect` on the Second PC. (Start counting from power on, not after entering the windows).
4. If activation is successful, it will load Windows normally. If it fails, the screen will remain black and you will not be able to access the Windows system.
<Note>
If you don't want to use Ditto Subscription after it expires, you can use this method:  
- Switch to the JTAG interface, after the Main PC is powered on and energized, Second PC burn the DMA firmware in the normal way. after completion, the Main PC completes a power-off reboot, and then it can start normally.
</Note>



### Better Activation Timing?

#### For FTDI Devices
1. Open `Device Manager` alongside the Ditto application.,
2. Expand the `Universal Serial Bus controllers` or the `Universal Serial Bus devices` section.
3. When you see `FTDI FT601 USB 3.0 Bridge Device` or the `FTDI SuperSpeed-FIFO Bridge` appear, wait 5 seconds, then hit “Connect” in Ditto.

#### For ZDMA Users
1. Open `Device Manager` alongside the Ditto application.
2. Expand the `Memory Technology Devices` section.
3. When you see `LeechDMA` appear, wait 5 seconds, then click `Connect` in Ditto.

#### For Ferrum Users
1. If you're using a Ferrum, just wait until your mouse shows up under the `Boards` category, then hit `Connect` in Ditto.

This timing trick should completely eliminate your connection headaches.
