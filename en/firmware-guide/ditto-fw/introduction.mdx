# Ditto

## Overview

Ditto is a software-level shape-shifting framework for PCIe device emulation.

## What Does This Mean?

From a PCIe device emulation perspective, Ditto provides APIs and building blocks for "correct" behavior on emulating how "real" devices look and respond. This extends not only beyond the restrictions of the Xilinx core, but beyond its capabilities.

## Key Capabilities

- Virtual configuration space
- Virtual MMIO
- Interrupt handling (legacy, MSI, MSI-X)
- Out-of-the-box APIs for device communication buffers (NVMe, SATA, xHCI, etc.)

## Subscription Tiers

### Pro Tier
- Includes a limited subset of xHCI controller models
- Supports sub-devices (such as mouse) connections

### Ultimate Tier
- Provides the full set of xHCI controller models
