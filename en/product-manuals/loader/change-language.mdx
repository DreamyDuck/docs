## Loader Language
<Note>
For new users, you must log in once to download the language dependency package before you can switch languages normally.
</Note>
1. Run `Scarlet.exe` as **ADMINISTRATOR** as usual.
2. In the bottom area of the `Login` tab, there is an option to switch languages. Available languages include `English`, `Chinese Simplified`, and `Chinese Traditional`. You can contact us to request additional language options.
