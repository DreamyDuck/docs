## What is a Fuser in DMA Cheats?

The **Fuser** is a specialized hardware device used in **DMA (Direct Memory Access) cheat setups** to merge visual overlays (e.g., ESP, Wallhacks) from a secondary "cheat PC" with the raw gameplay feed from a gaming PC. This allows cheaters to see critical game data (like enemy positions or loot) directly on their main monitor **without modifying the game's memory**, making it highly effective for evading anti-cheat detection.

### Core Purpose

The Fuser acts as a **hardware overlay combiner**, blending two video signals:
- **Gaming PC**: Outputs the unaltered game video (e.g., via HDMI/DisplayPort).
- **Cheat PC**: Generates overlay data (ESP boxes, enemy outlines) based on DMA-read game memory.

By merging these signals, the Fuser displays cheat visuals **directly on the player's monitor**, as if they were part of the game itself. This avoids the need for software-based overlays (e.g., Discord or OBS), which are easily flagged by anti-cheat systems.

## Key Use Cases

- **ESP/Wallhacks**: Displays enemy locations, health bars, loot, and other metadata through walls.
- **Radar Hacks**: Shows a minimap overlay with real-time enemy positions.
- **Stream Safety**: Overlays are invisible in screenshots or recordings, allowing streamers to cheat undetected.
- **Zero In-Game Footprint**: No DLL injection or memory writes, reducing detection risks.

## How It Works with DMA

1. **DMA Card**: A hardware tool (e.g., FPGA board or PCIe device) reads game memory data from the gaming PC.
2. **Cheat PC**: Processes the DMA data and generates visual overlays (e.g., using Python/C++ scripts).
3. **Fuser Hardware**:
   - Receives the **gaming PC's video output** and the **cheat PC's overlay signal**.
   - Combines both signals into a single output sent to the monitor.
   - Works in real time with **near-zero latency** (critical for competitive play).

## Hardware Specifications

### Available Fuser Types
1. **HDMI Fuser (2k@120)**
   - Budget-friendly option
   - Supports up to 1080p@240Hz
   - Compatible with 1440p@144Hz
   
2. **DisplayPort Fuser**
   - Higher resolution support (1440p@144Hz or 4K@60Hz)
   - Enhanced synchronization capabilities
   
3. **4K Fuser (4k@120)**
   - Premium-tier option
   - Supports up to 4K@120Hz
   - Ideal for ultra-high-definition gaming

### Required Components
- DMA Card (e.g., CPT-75T)
- Second PC/Laptop for cheat software
- Compatible display cables (Fuser requires 3 cables: 2 for Display Input, 1 for Fuser Output)
- Compatible Graphics Card on **Second PC**. Your output needs to match the resolution and Hz of the **Gaming PC**, otherwise the ESP will appear visually choppy. **[Recommend a Dedicated Graphics Card]**

## Setup Requirements

### Hardware Configuration
- **Gaming PC** → Connected to Fuser via HDMI/DisplayPort
- **Cheat PC** → Connected to Fuser via secondary HDMI/DisplayPort
- **Fuser** → Outputs merged signal to the main monitor

### Software Requirements
- DMA memory-reading tools (e.g., Dumbo, FPGA-based solutions)
- Overlay rendering software (e.g., custom ESP frameworks)

### Basic Setup Steps
1. **Resolution Matching**
   - Ensure identical settings on both PCs
   - Configure refresh rates to match

2. **Hardware Connection**

   C[Cheat PC] --> B
   B --> D[Monitor]
   ```

3. **Display Configuration**
   - Enable display duplication on cheat PC
   - Configure overlay transparency settings
   - Test synchronization

## Advantages

- **Anti-Cheat Evasion**: Overlays are hardware-generated, bypassing kernel-level anti-cheat scans (e.g., **Vanguard**, **EasyAntiCheat**).
- **Plug-and-Play**: No complex driver installations; works at the hardware level.
- **High Compatibility**: Supports resolutions up to 4K@120Hz (depending on Fuser model).
- **Stream-Safe**: Invisible to recording software and screenshots
- **Zero Latency**: Optimized for real-time data transmission

## Limitations and Considerations

### Technical Constraints
- **Cost**: Fusers range from **$150-$500**, depending on resolution/refresh rate support.
- **Dependency on DMA**: Requires a DMA card and secondary cheat PC, increasing setup complexity.
- **Physical Setup**: Multiple cables and devices are needed, which can be cumbersome.
- Complex initial configuration

## Comparison to Software Overlays

| Feature               | Fuser (Hardware)          | Software Overlay (e.g., OBS)  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Anti-Cheat Risk**   | Very Low                  | High                          |
| **Latency**           | Near-zero                 | Variable (can lag)            |
| **Stream Safety**     | Overlays hidden           | Overlays visible              |
| **Cost**              | Expensive                 | Free/cheap                    |

## Conclusion

The **Fuser** is a cornerstone of modern DMA cheat setups, enabling undetectable visual enhancements by merging cheat overlays with raw gameplay at the hardware level. While costly and complex to configure, it remains the gold standard for players seeking a competitive edge without triggering anti-cheat systems.
