## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using API keys. You can generate an API key in your [Scarlet Dashboard](https://dashboard.scarlet.technology).

```javascript
// Example of authenticating with the Scarlet API
const scarlet = new ScarletAPI({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key_here'
});

// Now you can make authenticated requests
const devices = await scarlet.listDevices();
```

## Rate Limits

The Scarlet API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability:

| Plan | Rate Limit |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Free | 100 requests per minute |
| Pro | 500 requests per minute |
| Enterprise | Custom limits |

If you exceed these limits, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Endpoints

The Scarlet API provides the following main endpoint categories:

- **Device Management** - List, connect to, and manage Scarlet devices
- **Memory Operations** - Read and write memory on connected devices
- **Game Profiles** - Access and utilize game-specific memory layouts
- **User Management** - Manage user accounts and permissions
