## Getting Started with Scarlet Development

Scarlet provides a comprehensive SDK for developers who want to extend the functionality of their Scarlet devices or integrate Scarlet technology into their applications.

### Installing the Scarlet SDK

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install scarlet-sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add scarlet-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to connect to a Scarlet device and read memory:

```javascript
import { ScarletDevice } from 'scarlet-sdk';

// Initialize the device
const device = new ScarletDevice();

// Connect to the device
await device.connect();

// Read memory from a specific address
const memoryValue = await device.readMemory(0x12345678, 4); // Read 4 bytes from address 0x12345678

console.log('Memory value:', memoryValue);

// Disconnect when done
await device.disconnect();
```

## Advanced Features

### Memory Scanning

Scarlet SDK provides powerful memory scanning capabilities:

```javascript
// Scan for a specific value in memory
const results = await device.scanMemory({
  value: 100,
  valueType: 'int32',
  scanType: 'exact'
});

console.log(`Found ${results.length} matches`);

// Narrow down results with a second scan
const narrowedResults = await device.scanMemoryFromResults({
  results,
  value: 101,
  valueType: 'int32',
  scanType: 'increased'
});
```

### Memory Manipulation

You can also write to memory:

```javascript
// Write a value to memory
await device.writeMemory(0x12345678, 101, 'int32');
```

## Game-Specific Development

<Tip>
  Check our [Game Profiles](/game-profiles) documentation for game-specific memory layouts and offsets.
</Tip>

### Creating Game Mods

Scarlet allows developers to create mods for supported games:

```javascript
import { ScarletDevice, GameProfiles } from 'scarlet-sdk';

// Initialize with a specific game profile
const device = new ScarletDevice();
await device.connect();

// Load a game profile
const gameProfile = await device.loadGameProfile(GameProfiles.GAME_XYZ);

// Use game-specific functions
const playerHealth = await gameProfile.getPlayerHealth();
console.log('Player health:', playerHealth);

// Modify game values
await gameProfile.setPlayerHealth(100);
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Device not found">
    If your code cannot find the Scarlet device:
    1. Make sure the device is properly connected and powered on
    2. Check that you have the latest drivers installed
    3. Try reconnecting the device
    4. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access USB/PCIe devices
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Memory read/write errors">
    If you encounter errors when reading or writing memory:
    1. Verify that the address is valid for the current game/application
    2. Check that the process is running with sufficient privileges
    3. Ensure the game is in a compatible state (some games protect memory during certain operations)
