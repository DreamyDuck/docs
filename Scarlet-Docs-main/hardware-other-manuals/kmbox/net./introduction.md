# Introduction

## » What is kmbox Network

⑴ Secure. Its protocol is not public and cannot be characterized. Each box has an independent IP, port, and hardware encoding. It cannot be scanned with blocking socket communication.

⑵ Stable. It eliminates the possibility of restarting with a blank screen like serial port communication.

⑶ Fast. With a 100M network load, its communication speed is 100 times that of the original B board (compared to 115200 baud rate). The number of calls per second is close to 1,000 whereas board B can only afford 300 calls per second with the possibility of restarting on a blank screen if the calls are too frequent.

⑷ Automatically set to default (artificial trajectories). Eliminate abnormal keyboard and mouse data. For further info, please refer to function "kmNet\_mouse\_move\_auto".

⑸ Strong adaptability. No need to pair your mouse.

⑹ Users are able to modify USB parameters on device, customizing their own firmwares by unique features.

⑺ User-friendly UI design. Intuitive, easy to navigate and efficient in meeting user needs.

⑻ All functions of B board are available except onboard scripts.

⑼ It supports the monitoring of physical keyboard & mouse and blocking of their functions, which facilitates software writing.

⑽ Supports learning and copying functions of physical keyboard and mouse.(TBD)
