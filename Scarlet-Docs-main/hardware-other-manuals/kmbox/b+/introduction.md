# Introduction

## » What is kmbox B+ (pro)

Kmbox is a small and powerful USB development board which essentially functions as a keyboard and a mouse controller without having to install additional drivers or inject DLLs.

Scripts are completely separated from PC and run on CPU inside the box, which would easily allow ordinary keyboard and mouse (non-macro keyboard and mouse) programmable functions (macro functions).

A couple of simple python calls would turn ordinary keyboard and mouse into magic.

Not only that, it helps you get started with Python fairly quickly, learn programming, play with hardwares, etc. Whether it is the underlying hardware logic or the upper-layer framework application, kmbox will accompany you all the way. Definitely great for DIY enthusiasts.
