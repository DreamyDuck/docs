# Check Firmware Support

{% hint style="info" %}
This page is about how to check if your DMA firmware supports **Valorant**.
{% endhint %}

1. Run <mark style="color:red;">**Valorant**</mark> on **Main PC**.
2. Load into **Firing Range**.
3.  On **Second PC**, run [Speed Test Tools](../../hardware-other-manuals/dma-board/speed-test.md)

    > **Speed Appear** -> Firmware support (Support but not mean its Undetected)\
    > **No Speed Output** -> Firmware don't support/blocked Valorant

{% hint style="danger" %}
At the same time, the speed test tool and DMA software cannot run simultaneously; only one can be active.
{% endhint %}
