# How to use with Unlocker

1. Start unlocker.
2. Start dbd, let it load a little a few seconds, but also you can wait one minute, just so it loads a little. You can also try to continue (press any button to log in or whatever) but then you'll get the verification error - that's okay. Doing Step 3. without pressing before will be the same for both cases no matter if you get the verification error.
3. Start the cheat and press SSL Unlock.
4. Enjoy.
