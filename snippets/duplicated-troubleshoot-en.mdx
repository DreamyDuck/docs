- **Issue Analysis**  
    This will cause the keyboard/mouse triggers to have no effect. The main reason is that the Windows system version of the Main PC is too high. (The latest Security Patch has increased Kernel Protection, leading to this issue.)

- **Troubleshooting (Temporary Solution, not 100% works)**  
    1. Shutdown your **Main PC** and fully cut off the power electricity for 5 seconds then power on.

- **Troubleshooting (Completely Resolve)**  
    - Uninstall Lastest Windows Security Patch. **(Main PC)**
    - Reintall your Windows to Windows 10 22H2. **(Main PC)**
