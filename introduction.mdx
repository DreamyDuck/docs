# What's DMA

> Direct Memory Access (DMA) cheating is a high-level cheating method used in video games, particularly difficult to detect. Here's a simpler explanation of how it works:

## Understanding DMA

> DMA is a feature that lets dma hardware access the system's memory directly, bypassing the CPU.&#x20;
>
> Since the cheating device operates at the hardware level and outside the operating system's standard operations, it can manipulate the gameâ€™s data without being detected by traditional anti-cheat systems. These anti-cheat systems typically monitor software behavior, not hardware-level memory access.
